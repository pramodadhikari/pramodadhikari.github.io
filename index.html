ABOUT ME!!
I am an atmospheric/climate scientist focused on the regional aspects of climate change over the mountain environment. 
My doctorate research emphasized understanding the role of natural and anthropogenic aerosols in modulating cloud properties, regional and elevation-dependent precipitation distribution and intensity, and vertical and surface temperature distribution over the Central Himalayas, which are crucial for the regional hydroclimate. 
I have a broad interest in understanding the impact of climate change on the regional and local levels using satellite-based observational datasets, reanalysis, and numerical modeling. 
Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Wyoming, contributing to the WyACT (Wyoming Anticipating Climate Transitions) project.  
My role involves collecting CMIP6 climate model guidance for the Interior western US through the development and validation of dynamically downscaled historical simulations. 
This work is instrumental in running our standard Regional Climate Model, the output of which will be used for applied climate change impact studies. 
Additionally, the downscaled modeling output will be used by hydrologists and ecologists for collaborative modeling to understand the impact of future climate change approximately 40 years from now.
